# A link sharing app
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69e1bcc9-e916-4b4a-b16f-d469b177c89a)

- All requirements have been met, including the login and register pages, although they must be accessed manually by adding "/login" or "/register" to the URL.

- I have deployed the app on Vercel, but there appears to be an issue with the routing. Therefore, for testing link sharing and any other manual rerouting, a local clone is required.
