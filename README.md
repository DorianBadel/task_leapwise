# A link sharing app
- All requirements have been met, including the login and register pages, although they must be accessed manually by adding "/login" or "/register" to the URL.

- I have deployed the app on Vercel, but there appears to be an issue with the routing. Therefore, for testing link sharing and any other manual rerouting, a local clone is required.
